This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in TypeScript: unexpected type coercion that results in runtime errors.  The `add` function is intended to add two numbers, but due to TypeScript's type coercion rules, it compiles without error even when passed a string and a number. This leads to unexpected results (NaN) at runtime. The solution shows how to use type guards to prevent this issue and ensure type safety.
